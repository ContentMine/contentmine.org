	<h1>WikiFactMine - Wikimedian in Residence</h1>
  <p>Would you jump at the opportunity to be paid to help every human being share in the sum of all human knowledge?</p>
  <p>The WikiFactMine Project, run by ContentMine Ltd, is looking to hire a Wikimedian in Residence to be partly based at the Betty and Gordon Moore Library, University of Cambridge.
  </p>
  <p>We’re using machines to consume the academic literature and output facts that can be used by anyone. We want your help to make these facts as useful as possible on Wikipedia and Wikidata.
  </p>
  <p>We’re mining thousands of facts a day from the Open scientific literature and we want to see these used to improve the free and open Wikimedia community. You don’t have to be an expert Wikimedian currently but you will be a good communicator who will thrive and make friends in a very diverse, global community.
  </p>
  <p>We aim to use these facts to greatly increase the depth of information available and make sure that the information that is currently there comes from reliable sources. You’ll be helping to replace the famous “[citation needed]” with a reliable, verifiable citation and also to improve Wikidata: the free knowledge base.
  </p>
  <p>Our facts are principally from the bioscience community and we focus on Open Access publications so a basic background in science and a keenness for sharing knowledge is important. Technical competency and computer literacy will be vital but no programming will be required.
  </p>
  <p>You will also be an ambassador for text, data and content mining on- and offline. The work will involve in-person interactions with librarians, academics and members of the public in and around Cambridge.
  </p>
  <p>You’ll organise workshops to both increase engagement with the Wikimedia community and improve the facts that we mine through communication with domain experts.
  </p>
  <p>We’re a small not-for-profit with a team in Cambridge and across the world who are passionate about Open Knowledge, Open Science and really want to make an impact on liberating knowledge for the benefit of everyone. Come and join us!
  </p>
  <p>The residency will last 6 months full-time and you’ll need to be able to spend around half of your time in Cambridge interacting with people in-person.
  </p>
  <p>You can read the detailed Terms of Reference for the job below. To apply send a CV and covering letter to jobs@contentmine.org. For casual enquiries contact tom@contentmine.org.
